### Attendance Management System with Face Recognition
Homepage

### Project Description

This is an Attendance Management System that utilizes the power of face recognition technology to efficiently track and manage attendance. Built with Python and the Flask framework, this web application provides a user-friendly interface accessible from any web browser. The system's face recognition capabilities are powered by OpenCV, allowing accurate identification of users and automated attendance tracking. MongoDB is used as the backend database to securely store attendance records.

### Features

Face Recognition: The system employs advanced face recognition techniques to identify users and manage their attendance.

Web Application: Accessible through a web browser, the system's user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless experience for users.

### Database: Attendance data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

OpenCV: Leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV, the system achieves high accuracy in face recognition and tracking attendance.

### How to Use

Install Required Libraries: Before getting started, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.

Clone the GitHub Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Set Up the Database: Create a MongoDB database and configure the necessary credentials in the project files.

Run the Web Application: Launch the web application using the Flask framework, which will be hosted locally.
